##  GHG Emission Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various factors like emission sources, units, and reliability scores. The key steps include:

* **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and removed irrelevant columns.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Performed statistical summary and visualizations.
* **Feature Scaling**: Used StandardScaler to normalize features.
* **Model Training**: Implemented and evaluated regression models to predict emissions.
* **Evaluation**: Compared model performance using metrics like RÂ² score.

 **Tools Used**:
  Python , Pandas , NumPy , Scikit-learn , Matplotlib ,  Seaborn , Google Colab
